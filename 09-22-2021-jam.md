  - \textit{"including 301 different queries types"}, this could be used for reference when designing new linguistic phenomenon that is not covered by current evaluation datasets


- [ReaSCAN: Compositional Reasoning in Language Grounding](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.08994.pdf), `nips2021` `compositionality`

  - This paper analyzes the limitations of a previously proposed benchmark `gSCAN`, and build upon `gSCAN` a new dataset that requires compositional understanding and reasoning over entities and relations
  - Section 6 of this paper is worth reading, since it analyzes different types of compositional generalization types

- [A Plug-and-Play Method for Controlled Text Generation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.09707.pdf), `emnlp2021` `text generation` `plug-and-play`

  - given a topic or keyword, a `shift distribution` is added to the language model's step-wise distribution
  - there are many details ignored here, and should be reading into the paper itself

- [MIRRORWIC: On Eliciting Word-in-Context Representations from Pretrained Language Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.09237.pdf), `emnlp2021` `word embedding`

  - Word-in-Context task accomplished through representations from the pre-trained language model
  - a **contrastive learning** approach again!
