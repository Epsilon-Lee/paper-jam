- [Training Complex Models with Multi-Task Weak Supervision](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.02840.pdf), Dec. 7 2018.
  - Weaker forms of supervision that provide noisier but cheaper labels are often used
  - Issues:
    - weak supervision sources have diverse and unknown accuracies
    - may output correlated labels
    - label different tasks
    - apply at different levels of granularity
  - They show that by solving a matrix completion-style problem, they can recover the accuracies of these multi-task sources given their dependency structure, but without any labeled data, leading to higher-quality supervision for training an end model
