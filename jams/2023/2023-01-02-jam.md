## Beyond MLE

- [Quantile risk control: a flexible framework for bounding the probability of high-loss prediction](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.13629.pdf), Dec. 27 2022.
  - previous works: bounding the expected loss of a predictor --> problem: not sufficient in risk-sensitive applications where the _distribution of errors_ is important
  - propose a flexible framework to produce a family of bounds on quantiles of the loss distribution incurred by a predictor.
