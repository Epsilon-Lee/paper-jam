### Online learning

- [Learn, Unlearn and Relearn: An Online Learning Paradigm for Deep Neural Networks](https://openreview.net/forum?id=gUTKBS34Q5c), `tmlr2023`. [tweet](https://twitter.com/ElaheArani/status/1620483890564718592).
  - Deep neural networks (DNNs) are often trained with the premise that the complete training data set is provided ahead of time. However, in real-world scenarios, data often arrive in chunks over time. This leads to important considerations about the optimal strategy for training DNNs, such as whether to fine-tune them with each chunk of incoming data (warm-start) or to retrain them from scratch with the entire corpus of data whenever a new chunk is available. While employing the latter for training can be computationally inefficient, recent work has pointed out the lack of generalization in warm-start models. Therefore, to strike a balance between efficiency and generalization, we introduce \textit{Learn, Unlearn, and Relearn (LURE)} an online learning paradigm for DNNs. LURE interchanges between the unlearning phase, which selectively forgets the undesirable information in the model through weight reinitialization in a data-dependent manner, and the relearning phase, which emphasizes learning on generalizable features. We show that our training paradigm provides consistent performance gains across datasets in both classification and few-shot settings. We further show that it leads to more robust and well-calibrated models.

  - We collected over 200 notable ML models and estimated their training dataset size.
  - Vision and language datasets have historically grown at 0.1 and 0.2 orders of magnitude (OOMs) per year, respectively.
  - There seems to be some transition around 2014-2015, after which training datasets became much bigger and (in the case of language) smaller datasets disappeared. This might be just an artefact of our small sample size.
  - We also provide trends for games, speech, recommendation and drawing, but since our sample size is very small in these domains we would advise some level of scepticism.
