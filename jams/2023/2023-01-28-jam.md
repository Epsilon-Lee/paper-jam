  - Detailed and tailored guide for undergraduate students or anybody want to dig deep into the field of AI with solid foundation.
- [intro_machine_learning](https://github.com/PrincetonUniversity/intro_machine_learning).
  - This mini-course will provide a comprehensive introduction to machine learning. Part 1 will briefly overview the full machine learning process and cover introductory concepts such as what is machine learning and why is it used. Popular software libraries will be discussed. Attendees will begin working hands-on in Part 2 to train simple machine learning models. Part 3 covers model evaluation and refinement. Artificial neural networks are introduced during Part 4. The mini-course concludes with a hackathon during Part 5 where participants will work on a small, end-to-end machine learning project chosen from one of multiple domains.
