  - They propose a qa setting named SituatedQA, where (temporal, geographical) contexts influece the answer.
  - Focusing on **information seeking questions**
  - They identify situated qa pairs in existing qa datasets (16% of NQ-Open dataset)
  - How to create context? crowdsourcing for (context, answer) w.r.t. such questions
  - Quantify how traditional models **fail** on situated questions
  - `My two cents` This paper demonstrates a way of doing research, that is to find out or create in/from test sets new instances which cannot be handled well by current model
