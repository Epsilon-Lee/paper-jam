# paper-jam
Jam of papers that interest or bore me.

To annotate paper, use the following `emoji` to indicate the depth of my understanding:
- no emoji means not read;
- (:white_heart:) white heart emoji means read a some important parts;
- (:green_heart:) green heart emoji means read all of it, especially its position, method and analysis;
- (:heart:) red heart emoji means not only grasp the main ideas, methods, experiments, but also have a strong feeling that I can re-implement and reproduce its results.
