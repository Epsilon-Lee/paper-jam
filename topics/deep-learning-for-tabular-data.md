- [Deep Neural Networks and Tabular Data: A Survey](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9998482), Feb. 2022.

## Methods and critics

- [Tabular Data: Deep learning is not all you need](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.03253.pdf), Nov. 23 2021.
- [Why do tree-based models still outperform deep learning on tabular data?](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.08815.pdf), Jul. 18 2022. [benchmark](https://github.com/LeoGrin/tabular-benchmark).
- [PTab: Using the Pre-trained Language Model for Modeling Tabular Data](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.08060.pdf), Sep. 15 2022.
  - Using key-value format for including semantics of table headers and utilizing pretrained language models like BERT.
- [TabPFN: A Transformer that solves small tabular classification problems in a second](https://table-representation-learning.github.io/assets/papers/tabpfn_a_transformer_that_solv.pdf), `nips2022`. [code](https://huggingface.co/spaces/TabPFN/TabPFN).
- [Transfer Learning with Deep Tabular Models](https://table-representation-learning.github.io/assets/papers/transfer_learning_with_deep_ta.pdf), `nips2022`.
  - It seems that dl can outperform XGBoost via transfer learning.
