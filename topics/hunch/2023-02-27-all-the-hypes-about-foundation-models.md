I would like to start a new hunch page with the title ***All the hypes about foundation models***. What I feel about is an upcoming revolution of our society's production situation due to the lauching of ChatGPT and the development of applications it stimulates. Let me begin the recording.

From a technical viewpoint, I judge the following directions be extremely important and useful (maybe in the near future):
- Jim Fan's [tweet](https://twitter.com/DrJimFan/status/1629878724886949888) speaks out the imagined future of decentralized training of LLMs;
- Plug-and-Play database as knowledge resource usable by ChatGPT-like LLMs;
- Plug-and-Play task description-based training of ChatGPT-like LLMs (e.g. see Jack Rae's [tweet](https://twitter.com/drjwrae/status/1629939121828560898)).
