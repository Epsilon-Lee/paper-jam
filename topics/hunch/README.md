***hunch*** is motivated by an old webpage [metahunch](https://metahunch.github.io/) of me and my friends.
The original motivation of that webpage is to discuss some exciting insights from others' research works.
Currently, the update of that webpage might be very slow, so I would like to start here a new archive of hunches from my daily experience or from personal communications with my friends.
Most of these hunches aim at pointing to my current understandings and **questions** about AI, machine learning and natural language processing.

Hope I could find research questions that are both important and appealing to my taste here :P
