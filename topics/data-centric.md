## Data-centric AI/Machine Learning

This repo is used to hold papers that propose data-centric perspectives for machine learning, for examples:
- [Understanding data augmentation](#understanding-data-augmentation)
- [Data curation]() (data cleaning, deduplication)
- Dataset distillation (data summarization, coreset, prototype)
- fast cross-validation (Jackknife)
- data attribution and data valuation
- data removal and machine unlearning
